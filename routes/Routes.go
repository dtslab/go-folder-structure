package routes

func Routes() {
	// code for route should be place here
	// also controller name can be passed here

	// so exact way how its working is that
		1. Routes called - Controllerconstconst
		2. Controller called Seviceconst
		3. Service does the required things and also calls -> DB Operations like fetch/update etc and gives the result 
}
